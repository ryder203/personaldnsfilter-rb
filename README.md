personalDNSfilter RB is a tiny Android app that helps you protecting your system against unwanted content. It runs in the background filtering the stuff you do not need and want, without draining your battery. You can use personalDNSfilter RB without having your system rooted. The app is not available on Google Play, because Google does not allow ad-blockers in their store. personalDNSfilter RB is and will always be free and open source software.
